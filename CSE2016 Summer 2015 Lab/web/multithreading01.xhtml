            <h2>Multithreading 01</h2>
            <div>Write a Java Multithreaded application that does as follows:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Find the sum of all odd numbers between X and Y
                    <ul>
                        <li>X and Y are integers such that X &lt; Y</li>
                        <li>Value of X and Y will be provided when you will run your program</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You need to split the numbers in 4 sets of equal length (the length of some sets maybe 1 less or 1 more)</li>
                <li>For example, given X = 5 and Y = 33 you can split them as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>{5, 7, 9, 11}</li>
                        <li>{13, 15, 17}</li>
                        <li>{19, 21, 23}</li>
                        <li>{25, 27, 29, 31, 33}</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Create 4 separate threads and ask each of them to find the sum of the set of numbers you provided</li>
                <li>Once you got all the addition results from all the threads, add them up and print out the final result</li>
            </ul>
        </ui:composition>
    </h:body>
